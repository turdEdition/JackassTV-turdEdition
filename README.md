# Jackass: The TV Show - TURD Edition v1.0
### A restoration of the original broadcast version of the Jackass TV Show

This project aims to get as close to the original broadcast version, in as high quality, as possible. The aim is to fix the main issues that all the official releases of the show have:

- Large amounts of the original soundtrack were replaced due to licensing issues.
- A number of skits have not been officially released since broadcast due to legal issues.
- A number of skits in the officially released versions have content cut.
- No official release is formatted in the same way as the original broadcast with skits being shown out of order than originally intended.

The audio in this release is sourced from the tv rips that have been floating around the internet for over a decade and the video is taken from multiple different official sources. Where the official high-quality video does not exist the original tv rip has been upscaled.
